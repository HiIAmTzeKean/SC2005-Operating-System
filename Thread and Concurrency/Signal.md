# Signal

## 2 types of signal

[[Synchronous signal]] and [[Asynchronous signal]]

## Signal servicing

1. Signal is generated by event
2. Signal delivered to process
3. Signal serviced by process

Signal can then be serviced by either **default signal handler** that kernels runs to service signal. The default can also be overwritten by **user-defined signal handler**.
