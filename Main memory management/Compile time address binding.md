# Compile time address binding

If memory location is known a priori, absolute code can be generated.

## Advantage

1. No logical address generated
    1. Physical address directly generated by compiler
    2. [[Logical address space]] same as [[Physical address space]]
2. Efficient code
3. Checking can be done early

## Disadvantage

1. Not flexible for memory allocation
2. Not portable
