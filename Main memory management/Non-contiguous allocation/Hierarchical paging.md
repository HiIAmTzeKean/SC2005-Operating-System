# Hierarchical paging

Multi-level [[Paging]]. Concept is to [[Page]] a [[Page table]].

## 2 level [[Page]] scheme

Given a 32 bit system and each page is 4K size, the page offset will be 12 bits.

Leaving the number of possible page entries in table to be $2^{20}$. For a 32 bit system, assume that the entry needs 32 bits to store the physical address, then each entry is 4 bytes.
