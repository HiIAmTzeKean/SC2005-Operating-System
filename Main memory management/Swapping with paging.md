# [[Swapping]] with paging

Swapping of pages of a process instead of entire process seen in [[Standard swapping]]. **Page out** refers to moving page from memory to [[Backing store]] and **page in** refers to the reverse.

## Advantage

1. [[Main memory|Physical memory]] can be oversubscribed but does not incur cost of swapping entire [[Process]] -> Greater [[Multithread]]
2. Complements [[Virtual memory]]
