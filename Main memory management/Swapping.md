# Swapping

For [[Process]] to be executed, it must be loaded into [[Main memory]]. For a limited physical memory, processes can be swapped out of memory into a [[Backing store]] and then brought back into memory for continued execution.

## Types of swapping

1. [[Standard swapping]]
2. [[Swapping with paging]]

## Advantage

1. Total [[Physical address space]] of all process can exceed real physical memory of system
