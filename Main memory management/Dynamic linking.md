# Dynamic linking

Linking postponed to be done by loader and during runtime.

1. OS checks if routine in memory
2. Loades the process [[Address space]] if routine found
3. During runtime, [[stub]] used to locate library routine in address space
4. Stub replaces itself with address of routine and executes the routine
