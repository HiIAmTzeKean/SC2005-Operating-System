# Standard swapping

Moving entire [[Process]] between [[Main memory]] and [[Backing store]]. This method is no longer used in modern systems as the cost of swapping is high.

## Advantage

1. [[Main memory|Physical memory]] to be oversubscribed
    1. OS can accommodate more processes than there is actual physical memory -> [[Multithread|Multithreading]]

## Disadvantage

1. Time to perform standard swapping is prohibitive
