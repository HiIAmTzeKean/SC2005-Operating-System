| Paging                                          | Segmentation                                      |
| ----------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| [[Non-contiguous allocation]]                   | [[Non-contiguous allocation]]                     |
| Dividing [[Program]] into fixed [[Page]]        | Dividing [[Program]] into segments                |
| OS responsible                                  | Complier responsible                              |
| Paging faster                                   |                                                   |
