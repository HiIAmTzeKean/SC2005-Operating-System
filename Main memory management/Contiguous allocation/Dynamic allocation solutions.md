# Dynamic allocation solutions

Satisfy a request from size $n$ to form a list of free holes. 

3 common approaches:
- [[First-fit]]
- [[Best fit]]
- [[Worst-fit]]

First-fit and Best-fit are better than worse fit in **time** and **storage utilization** but suffers from [[External fragmentation]].
First-fit fastest among all 3.
