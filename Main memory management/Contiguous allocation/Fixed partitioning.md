# Fixed partitioning

For this [[Contiguous allocation]], partition size is fixed. Adheres to principles of contiguous allocation.

## Disadvantage

1. [[Internal fragmentation]] if [[Process]] is smaller than partition
2. [[External fragmentation]]
3. Limitation on the size of the process as all process must follow the partition size
