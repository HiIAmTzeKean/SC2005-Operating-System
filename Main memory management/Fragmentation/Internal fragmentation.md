# Internal [[Fragmentation]]

> Memory wastage from unused allocation due to size of process being smaller than partition

When OS allocates memory to [[Process]], there is overhead to keep track of holes especially when the hole is small. OS typically breaks down [[Main memory|Physical memory]] into fixed size blocks and allocate memory based on block size. Thus, **memory allocated** to [[Process]] may be slightly **larger** than **requested** memory.
