# [[Liveness]] failure

Defined as the result of using [[Synchronisation tools summary]] to coordinate [[Critical section]] as there is a possibility [[Process]] will wait indefinitely.

Indefinite waiting violates [[Critical section solution criteria#Progress]] and [[Critical section solution criteria#Bounded waiting]].Results of liveness failure can lead to **poor performance** and **responsiveness**.
