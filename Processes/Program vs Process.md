# [[Program]] vs [[Process]]

A program becomes a process when an executable file is loaded into memory.

2 processes may be associated with the same program, but are always considered as 2 separate execution sequences. There could be multiple copies of the same program being executed, where the text section are equivalent, but the data, stack and heap contents vary.
