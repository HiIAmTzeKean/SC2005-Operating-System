# [[Process]] state

As process executes it changes state which is defined by the current activity of the process.

![[process state diagram.png]]

Consist of 5 states

1. [[New state]]
2. [[Running state]]
3. [[Waiting state]]
4. [[Ready state]]
5. [[Terminated state]]

Only one process can only be in the [[Running state]] on a processor core at any instant.

## State transition

There is a [[Timer interrupt]] generated by a hardware clock that tracks progress of time. The interrupt will be raised to the CPU and [[CPU scheduler]] will pick a process from the ready queue.
