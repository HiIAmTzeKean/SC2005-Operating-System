# Context switch

[[Interrupt]] causes OS to change a CPU core from current task to a [[Kernel routine]]. OS will then save context of [[Process]] and restore it later.

Context switch time is pure overhead as no useful work is done. Speed depends on memory speed, number of registers and other factors.
