# Application programming interface

API is used to establish connectivity to hardware and applications. APIs provides function calls that can be made to a library to perform an operation.

Programmers use a [[System call]] API to access system call services. These API reside in a library and abstract the hardware from the programmer.

## Example

Programmer was to open a file in C program code. There will be a line "filein = fopen()". This is the API that the programmer use, and the call is from the standard C library.

The compiler will translate this API call by accessing the C library to obtain the full code which maps to the "open()" operation. The open() call is a [[System call]] which request for the OS to open the file.
